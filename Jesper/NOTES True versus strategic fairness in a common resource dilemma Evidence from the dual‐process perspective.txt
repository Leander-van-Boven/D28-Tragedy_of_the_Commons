True versus strategic fairness in a common resource dilemma: Evidence from the dual‐process perspective

proself -- procosial (Selfishly oriented or socially oriented)
intuition -- deliberation (intuitive decision or deliberative decision)

How does proself/prosocialness (Social Value Orientation SVO) moderate result difference between intuition/deliberation when used in CPR problem?

--> SVO Consistently moderates relationship between intuitive/deliberate processing and cooperation decisions (in CPR)

-- proself generally less money from resource pool when deliberative wrt to intuitive/deliberate
		--> Concern 4 fairness is strategic (strategic fairness)
-- procosial similar requests in both conditions
		--> Concern 4 fairness is intuitive (true fairness)


Use CPR scenario where agents have variable time for deliberation (to go fishing or not to go fishing, that's the question), such that sometimes they need to act quickly to survive. Implement above types of agents, with variable SVO ranging from e.g. -1 (proself) to 1 (prosocial) that alters how they respond to the time they have to deliberate their decision. if SVO close to -1, they will make social decision only if they have time to make a strategic decision. If not much time, they will make more selfish decision. If SVO close to 1, they will more consistently make social decisions. 

RQ: (How) do different agent distribution w/ different params (SVO dist., rate of influence of deliberation time to socialness of decision) converge?
